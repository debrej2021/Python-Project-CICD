# Python-Project-CICD

I created a simple repository with a simple python file doing addition and substraction
I then created the .github\workflows and added the ci.yml file into it 
I also added a requirements.txt file 
I have attached github_actions_run.png as screen shot of some of the runs .
I had to create a Python test file test_simple_python as well 
Since its a simple App , it doesnt have any secrets .
